Description:

The Batch Addon Installer is a Blender addon that allows you to install multiple addons from a specific folder with ease. Instead of manually installing each addon one by one, this addon automates the process by recursively searching for addon files (.py or .zip) in a designated folder and installing them in Blender. It provides a convenient way to quickly add multiple addons to your Blender setup.

Features:

Installs multiple addons at once from a specified folder
Supports recursive search in subfolders for addon files
Provides a progress bar during the installation process
Easy-to-use interface for setting the addon folder
Installation:

Download the addon ZIP file.
In Blender, go to "Edit" > "Preferences" > "Add-ons".
Click on the "Install" button.
Navigate to the downloaded addon ZIP file and select it.
Enable the "Batch Addon Installer" checkbox to activate the addon.
Usage:

Open Blender and go to "File" > "User Preferences" > "Addons".
Locate the "Batch Addon Installer" addon and expand its settings.
Set the addon folder by clicking on the folder icon and selecting the desired folder.
Click on the "Install Addons in Batch" button to start the installation process.
A progress bar will appear, indicating the progress of addon installation.
Once the installation is complete, the addons will be available in Blender.
Note:

Make sure that the addon files (.py or .zip) are placed in the specified folder before running the batch installation.
